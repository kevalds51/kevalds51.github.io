I've been at Splunk since 2019, right after I graduated out of grad school! I've climed two steps on the corporate ladder so far: intern -> entry-level -> mid-level

Across my time at Splunk - I've worked 4 scrum teams and have contributed directly to 3 different products: VictorOps (now Splunk on-call), Infrastructure Monitoring and Incident-Intelligence of the Observability Suite

I've had the opportunity to work with a super diverse work-force, using a colorful palette of languages and tools and on the most mythical to magical infrastruture plaforms.
